Selecting evenly matched teams
Given a list of Players (see class detail in project), divide them into two evenly matched teams and return the difference between the teams total Score values, if sides can be matched exactly then the result should be 0

If the number of players passed in is even then the teams should be divided equally, if the number of players is odd then one team will have one more player than the other team

You can assume that:

- each Player's Score will be a number between 0 and 100
- the maximum number of players passed in will be 10
